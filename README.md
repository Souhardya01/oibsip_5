# oibsip_5
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.
# Data Analytics Projects

## Project Overview

### House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The primary steps include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building using regression techniques
- Model evaluation and optimization

## Data

- **House Price Dataset**: Contains data on house prices along with features such as location, size, and amenities.

Datasets can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

Each project has its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file located in the `notebooks/` directory. To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the corresponding notebook and run the cells sequentially.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-projects.git
cd data-analysis-projects
jupyter notebook
